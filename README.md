# Benchmarker (Rails)

I have a smaller app called [Benchmarker](https://github.com/jeffnyman/benchmarker) and that was written in the context of a series of posts and training material that I provided about [testability](http://testerstories.com/category/testing/testability/).

That was based on my reading of the book [Rails 5 Test Prescriptions](https://pragprog.com/book/nrtest3/rails-5-test-prescriptions) by Noel Rappin wherein he creates a Rails application called Gatherer. Beyond changing the context of the example a bit, I also took a more deliberate approach in calling out aspects of testing.

However my Benchmarker application was not, in fact, a Rails application. It was just a pure Ruby application which was plenty fine for the purposes of my training material. In this new iteration of Benchmarker I am going to utilize a Rails context.
